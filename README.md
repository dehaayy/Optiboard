# Optiboard
An object-oriented boarding simulation from scratch using Python and Pygame to optimize passenger boarding for airlines. Offers a platform to test different boarding strategies,Â analyze their effectiveness, and animate the boarding supporting data-driven decision-making for airline operators. Runs on a timer and offers adjustable speed settings.


# How to Run
1. Download the "Optiboard.py"
2. You can adjust the parameters
   - `speed_multiplier`: Indicates the speed of the simulation, 1 being the real life speed, while default 10 being simulation running in 10x the original speed of the real world boarding.
