# Optiboard
An object-oriented boarding simulation from scratch using Python and Pygame to optimize passenger boarding for airlines. Offers a platform to test different boarding strategies,Â analyze their effectiveness, and animate the boarding supporting data-driven decision-making for airline operators. Runs on a timer and offers adjustable speed settings.


# How to Run
1. Download the "Optiboard.py"
2. You can adjust the parameters
   - `speed_multiplier`: Indicates the speed of the simulation, 1 being the real life speed, while default 10 being simulation running in 10x the original speed of the real world boarding.
   - `combinations`: The exact order of seat numbers that you want to simulate passengers to board in. 3 options are provided.
3. Other parameters are for default and design purposes
4. Go on to the terminal, go to the path of the python file, (such as `cd desktop` if the file is located on your desktop.
5. Make sure the `Pygame` library is installed to your computer (pip Pygame) -command may change based on your specific python version
6. Run on terminal through command "python Optiboard.py" , or a common python IDE. Command may change based on the specific version of Python you have

 
# The Output
Once the simulation ends, the elapsed time is displayed to the screen. This is one metric focused on this simulation to assess the quality of the boarding strategies

# The Jupyter Notebook
There is also a Jupyter Notebook soon coming that enables you to run multiple conditions automatically for an indicated amount of times and export the results in CSV or Excel for further analysis.
